ss0;Had a really awkward time ordering a beer because nothing on the menu was stocked . ;0;1;1;0;0
ss1;I really enjoyed ( non - sarcastically ) having an overpriced drink here because it reminded me of New York . ;1;0;0;1;0
ss2;We got here just before the peak lunch crowd on a Saturday morning , and still had to wait 30 minutes , which gave us enough time to find parking down the street .;0;1;0;1;0
ss3;Hence the food is way too pricey for what 's offered ;1;0;0;0;0
ss4;I can not believe someone was not satisfied with the quality of the chicken at this location ! ;0;0;1;0;0
ss5;I love their location in LA and was hoping to get the great service I usually get when I shop over there . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss6;Delicious food , friendly people , quick . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss7;Horrible service attitude . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss8;Great service at lunch . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss9;Environment is very open , clean and comfortable . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss10;Our server actually seemed annoyed that he had to talk with us ... Just another table and more faces ... More orders ... Move it along . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss11;She even stayed with me after closing to make sure I got everything I needed ;0;1;0;0;0
ss12;WAY OVER PRICED ! $ 39 for the dish pictured .;1;0;0;0;0
ss13;The decor looks a little old fashioned , but that actually adds to the feel and I like it . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss14;They do not accept reservations , but it is worth the wait . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss15;The product itself is a repellent combination of over intense flavours ;0;0;1;0;0
ss16;For how much it cost , it could have been better . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss17;Parking can be a issue and they no longer have the dog pen . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss18;All you can say is yuuummmmmmmmyy , the line was n't bad given we were there around 3 pm;0;1;0;0;0
ss19;The shoe was on special price so we got a good deal and bought the shoe as well ! ;1;0;1;0;0
ss20;Service is n't great either . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss21;This mall actually feels like one in Las Vegas . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss22;I love that for things you order regularly you can establish a standing order and get a 5 % discount ( milk , eggs , etc . ) .;1;0;0;0;0
ss23;The servers were a bit confused ;0;1;0;0;0
ss24;It was a little last minute and they were extremely accommodating . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss25;Super quick food lines and attentive employees . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss26;This place is a treasure , and the atmosphere is amazing as well . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss27;For the price I paid , I get more with a vist to another fast food competitor . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss28;Everything fresh and all full of flavor . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss29;The food quality is average and their service is slower than slow ;0;1;0;0;0
ss30;For under $ 7 you get a custom made sub sandwich .;1;0;1;0;0
ss31;It was definitely not worth the money ;1;0;0;0;0
ss32;Very dark and stylish and clearly they were aiming for something of a cross between a club feel date night and just a nice evening out that you would like to bring someone special . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss33;The only problem we really had was the ladies at the front office were sorta rude and looked annoyed at us . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss34;some of the items they sale here are a bit over priced but if you do n't mind paying a bit extra this is the place to go . ;1;0;0;1;0
ss35;slow but courteous . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss36;The ambience , service , and food was pretty cool here . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss37;Unbelievable , it was me & my mother so it was a total of 100 $ i could have gone to red lobster and ate better quality of food .;1;0;0;0;0
ss38;The meal was delicious   and reasonably priced . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss39;The guy told me if I buy a $ 5 sub then I get less vegetables than an $ 8 sub .;1;0;0;0;0
ss40;The only negatives are that the inside is really small , so seating is incredibly cramped and could not accommodate groups ;0;0;0;1;0
ss41;And it 's terribly over priced for the quality . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss42;The dipping ramen was slightly too salty . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss43;Well , massively disappointed with this place . Fries were cold , I mean 5 HOUR cold ! ! The burger ? Smashed together like they were trying to save space in bvb yge bag .;0;0;1;0;0
ss44;50 $ for buffet and mind you i only ate crab legs;1;0;0;0;0
ss45;Too many other places to shop with better prices . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss46;I bought a Living Social deal $ 30 for $ 60 awhile back .;1;0;1;0;0
ss47;I sat outdoors and enjoyed the nice string lighting and music that was playing ;0;0;0;1;0
ss48;They have some great offers going on now with even 70 % off on some items .;1;0;0;0;0
ss49;Jimmy really cares about his customers and his craft . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss50;My other dining companions seemed pleased with their food ( one ordered a veal marsala that I did not try and the other - my favorite - ordered off the menu , actually , a request they were kind enough to accommodate - it was gnocchi caprese with pesto sauce instead of tomato sauce , and it was gooeyyummydelicious ) ! ;0;1;1;0;0
ss51;The food is awesome , fresh , delicious and the best part is , it 's still healthy . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss52;It took the one and only waitress at least 1 hour to serve our food .;0;1;0;0;0
ss53;the interior is clean and has an almost perfect health rating ;0;0;0;1;0
ss54;A little expensive but I 'll definitely be back time and time again ;1;0;0;0;0
ss55;And they let me apply the discount to both of our tickets . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss56;The food was delicious , and the cake was to die for . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss57;Great chicken , but go during a weekday lunch time to avoid the crowds ;0;0;1;0;0
ss58;No appointment on a Saturday afternoon and they managed to get me in and out in an hour . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss59;The seafood was not fresh . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss60;The food is pretty good ;0;0;1;0;0
ss61;I did end up finding the perfect doll . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss62;Overpriced wanna be burger and brew place . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss63;The staff is always friendly and they make you feel comfortable even when you 're getting uncomfortable work done . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss64;Everything we tried so far was delicious ! ;0;0;1;0;0
ss65;Their service is typically slow and unfriendly ;0;1;0;0;0
ss66;Environment was lively and diverse . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss67;Not worth the 40.00 for a basic cut .;1;0;0;0;0
ss68;I am not from the area , and parking is tough ;0;0;0;1;0
ss69;The portion sizes here are gigantic .... we ordered based on our hunger level and should have ordered one plate to share . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss70;Unfortunately several times its been undercooked where literally another 90sec would ' ve made it awesome;0;0;1;0;0
ss71;They need to chill on their prices . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss72;Customer service told me nothing was rescheduled ;0;1;0;0;0
ss73;Our host Reinhold is so nice and gracious . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss74;The manager and staff were friendly , which is always a nice bonus . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss75;Prices are not bad and they have a good amount of seats ( and take reservations ) . ;1;1;0;1;0
ss76;I felt like I was at a fine dining establishment . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss77;Very reasonably priced and came right on budget . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss78;"The food is quite tasty , but the operation around is , let 's say "" challenged "" . ";0;1;1;0;0
ss79;She then decided that the only thing to do was be rude to me . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss80;$ 45 for three of us with large appetites .;1;0;0;0;0
ss81;Do not eat here , it is unsanitary . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss82;It 's such a modern restaurant but their dishes are authentic and super delicious ;0;0;1;0;0
ss83;ALL of the Mexican food was HALF PRICE . ;1;0;1;0;0
ss84;Always a good time ! The food was on point as always .. They can cook a Steak like no other ! Sometimes better than the keg . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss85;However , once our dinner came I thought the food was average at best . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss86;There 's nothing striking about the environment or decor here , but do not leave without trying the dried , saut√©ed green beans ;0;0;1;1;0
ss87;The staff is very kind and knowledgeable , and they remember my pup 's name when I bring him in . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss88;I was looking for golf shoes , and found some that felt good and fit well but had no price . ;1;0;1;0;0
ss89;The staff and service was really good . I highly recommend this place . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss90;Also , the smell of the restaurant was very bothersome . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss91;Staff is nice and would help to fulfill your requests . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss92;The restaurant is inside an old style passenger train , which gives it more character . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss93;I went by around 1:30p on a Friday and there were still plenty of tables available even though they were busy and had nice outdoor seating as well .;0;0;0;1;0
ss94;When we were about to pay , the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the 1/2 off Scoutmob deal , so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except $ 8 difference ... REALLY ? ! ?;1;1;0;0;0
ss95;The server ( Scottie ) I think was trying to hard to be funny and came across as rude and careless in my opinion . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss96;This is the best sushi in town ;0;0;1;0;0
ss97;Friendly staff . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss98;The waiting staff were very nice . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss99;All the instructors are friendly and helpful . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss100;Some of the items they sale here are a bit over priced ;1;0;0;0;0
ss101;Me : Then why did you tell me they were on discount ? ;1;0;0;0;0
ss102;Our waitress and the Manager are what make good establishments exceptional . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss103;Perfect little spot with healthy options and everything was so delicious . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss104;Only downside : three entrees served simultaneously but fourth ( beet/ goat cheese ravioli ) was 2 - 3 minutes later which allowed my accompaniments ( delicious creamy polenta ) to cool off to much .;0;1;1;0;0
ss105;We arrived at 6 pm and the employees told us the order was n't ready .;0;1;0;0;0
ss106;I tried to contact them through the app and website and still have n't heard back . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss107;The wait staff is attentive and knowledge ;0;1;0;0;0
ss108;The girl at check in that took my info just started typing away and did not explain anything to me . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss109;Friendly w / great customer service , reasonable prices , and a chill atmosphere ;1;1;0;1;0
ss110;The service is excellent and the family feel of this place is so great . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss111;Prices were reasonable and mission accomplished ! ;1;0;0;0;0
ss112;They should be shut down for terrible service . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss113;The main squeeze was definitely the value and quality of our meal . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss114;For the amenities and $ paid , it 's small . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss115;He ordered the tires , gave me a great price and it was done that same day . ;1;1;0;0;0
ss116;The ladies that work here are all so friendly ! ;0;1;0;0;0
ss117;Lots of free parking in the rear of the restaurant . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss118;The BBQ is wonderful and they have maybe the best collard greens I have had in the US . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss119;It was clear that she was more concerned with being right than being helpful . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss120;This camp has a loving , nurturing atmosphere that allows kids of all backgrounds and levels of arts experience to excel . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss121;Employees have horrible attitudes ! ;0;1;0;0;0
ss122;the Pork Belly rice is also really good ;0;0;1;0;0
ss123;My only issue was the cleanliness of the restaurant . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss124;they are kind , polite , and take the time to explain everything ;0;1;0;0;0
ss125;but they are more expensive than what I ' ve paid in the past and what another shop charges ;1;0;0;0;0
ss126;Rodney and his crew gave us a great price and did the work so quick , literally , it was done before we knew it ;1;1;0;0;0
ss127;I assumed because they are located next to Intel ,   they figured they could charge a ridiculous price for a style . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss128;For the money we paid ( over 80 $ for 1 appetizer , 2 dinners , 2 drinks ) we could not eat much;1;0;0;0;0
ss129;This is the worst place for a hairstyle . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss130;Attentive and friendly service . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss131;Give me a good waiter and decent food and it 's hard to not impress . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss132;Poor quality sirloin covered in a thick brown sauce . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss133;Only complaint is they 're expensive ( $ 6.25 for 8) and the sizing is not consistent .;1;1;0;0;0
ss134;Gorgeous , gorgeous , gorgeous interior design , with small outdoor area . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss135;This particular location has a good check in deal . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss136;Pepe is usually there also greeting his customers with a smile and making sure everyone is taken care of . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss137;Even though the stuff is probably overpriced , you ca n't help but just want to buy up the whole store and bring it home with you . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss138;Reception hung up on me multiple times and would not listen . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss139;My phone screen was replaced in 30 minutes and looks great .;0;1;0;0;0
ss140;Always helpful , always wonderful , always available . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss141;My manicure was sloppy and uneven . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss142;all the staff there is amazing . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss143;Pricing reflects the demand -- it 's not CHEAP indian food ( Though not very expensive either ) . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss144;the waiter was friendly and helpful ;0;1;0;0;0
ss145;The store was clean and well organized ;0;0;0;1;0
ss146;Booking was easy , the staff was friendly , and they communicated very well . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss147;I purchased a Gibeon Meteorite and black zirconium wedding band from Rings Unique for approximately $ 1200 .;1;0;1;0;0
ss148;The food was n't half bad either , but I had the bar food staples . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss149;Rate increases totaling 36 % over 3 months resulted in my canceling my account here .;1;0;0;0;0
ss150;She also refused to provide the name of her boss in order for me to complain about the experience . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss151;Paid over $ 80 for a king crab leg with an upgraded side and two beers .;1;0;0;0;0
ss152;Dear Hyatt Place , if you are going to charge $ 75 for a pet fee , then tell me that my pet is n't allowed through the front door and lobby;1;0;0;0;0
ss153;Prices here are very reasonable ! ;1;0;0;0;0
ss154;Slowest coffee shop I ' ve been to in boston . Took 15 minutes for me to get a breakfast sandwich .;0;1;0;0;0
ss155;I like their outdoor seating in the front with sun . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss156;There is usually no wait for lunch but it can take really long to get a table at night ( they don¬¥t take reservations ) . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss157;The owners are the nicest people and the service is excellent . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss158;They were clearly not equipped for a group our size ;0;0;0;1;0
ss159;Only issue I have with this place is that they ' ve raised their prices twice in the last year and now it 's $ 2.10 for almost every plate which I think is very high for what you get;1;0;0;0;0
ss160;Prices vary so you have to shop around , but every once in a while you can find a really awesome deal . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss161;They have coupons discount for first second and third time customers through their website ;1;0;0;0;0
ss162;My parents told me a horror story about their friends ' wedding photographer , who insisted on always getting the shot he wanted . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss163;This place is only worth your time if you are looking for discount designer jeans ;1;0;0;0;0
ss164;The waiter was also really nice and the atmosphere is beautiful . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss165;Jamaal is a great instructor and provides personalised and hands - on corrections to ensure you get the best workout . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss166;The server was cold and seemingly uninterested in making our experience pleasant ;0;1;0;0;0
ss167;Extremely quick response to an appointment request and was able to groom our dog the very next day . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss168;The decor was cute and the service was quick . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss169;The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded , but he will not listen to them , and that she was ' proceeding to cancel this call ' .. ;0;1;0;0;0
ss170;While he checked on the price ( which seemed to take much more effort than it should have ) , I found the shoes on - line for almost half the price . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss171;Service exceptional . Continuously filling waters , etc . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss172;You get a much much larger portion for the same price at SFU ( the bowl is over - flowing ) . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss173;I still believe he did n't want to help to sit us together and used poor judgement setting up the tables ;0;1;0;0;0
ss174;The staff here were very pleasant even through the cancellation process , and seemed to realize that someone 's ending use of a unit did n't have to mean permanent loss of a customer . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss175;He was also slow on refilling our waters throughout the meal . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss176;Adult tickets are $ 13.50 but they have military discount .;1;0;0;0;0
ss177;disappointed in the fact they do n't tell you the price ;1;0;0;0;0
ss178;Great customer service , great food that is fresh and cooked to order . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss179;Sushi menu was pretty standard and the flavor was nothing special . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss180;The attention to customers I observed to be very good and free computer use is available in the lobby . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss181;Management is drippy ;0;1;0;0;0
ss182;The place was beautiful , immaculately clean , comfortable bedding ( lovely sheets ) and breakfast was delicious . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss183;We never get utensils , and it takes a great deal of effort to flag anyone down for refills or to order food ;0;1;0;0;0
ss184;It is a surreal experience and profound in that you live for a few hours as a blind person would , being served by a blind person . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss185;Appointment was quick and the staff was incredibly friendly . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss186;There was a nice beer and cocktail list to choose from as well . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss187;Today we waited over ten minutes behind one car in the drive thru for their single order ;0;1;0;0;0
ss188;Everyone is kind and professional , with no pretense . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss189;The flavors were not the best and the froyo itself was watery . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss190;They do not fill up your ice cream because they say they leave room so you can take your cap off , what about the big hole in the center of the lid ? ;0;0;1;0;0
ss191;They have an awesome return policy which makes me confident about the stuff I buy there . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss192;The rooms are nice , spacious and cozy . The huge 42 inch flat screen TV mounted to the wall made it covienent to watch TV from the cozy sectional or while in bed;0;0;0;1;0
ss193;there is no sense of urgency of your time at all ;0;1;0;0;0
ss194;I ordered mango & taro moochi in coconut milk for $ 6;1;0;1;0;0
ss195;Nail Time lowered their prices ;1;0;0;0;0
ss196;Service was awful , bathrooms were filthy and Wellesley 's stupid blue law about requiring every patron to order food while drinking is absurb . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss197;Fabulous service and awesome food ;0;1;0;0;0
ss198;Very very friendly and they made an effort with us . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss199;The manager that did my nails has the worst personality . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss200;Good food with great variety . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss201;This man is unstable and incompetent as a manager ;0;1;0;0;0
ss202;the lines may be long at times ;0;1;0;0;0
ss203;Our order was wrong as well as missing items . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss204;The portions are perfectly sized to fill you up without any leftovers . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss205;"Bubble teas are not so good ; they are cheap , so they are probably just right for the price . ";1;0;1;0;0
ss206;Large selection of dishes for under $ 9 and there is tons of food .;1;0;0;0;0
ss207;Better prices than most places for lobster rolls and seafood platters . ;1;0;1;0;0
ss208;Have not purchased fresh seafood here before but it 's available if you want it . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss209;Ladies at the counter are super helpful and friendly . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss210;We really enjoyed the BBQ ribs , brisket , and pulled pork . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss211;The building is pretty shanty like but the food is good . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss212;The black eyes peas and cornbread are delicious ! ;0;0;1;0;0
ss213;The restaurant was clean . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss214;Lots of picnic tables outside with lots of bees and flies buzzing around . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss215;Very covid friendly . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss216;It is a little pricy though , I drop about $ 200 per visit .;1;0;0;0;0
ss217;Not a cheap date , my pup ;1;0;0;0;0
ss218;there 's construction right in front of the building so parking and getting around are a bit difficult ;0;0;0;1;0
ss219;Not always worth the price for me , 4/5;1;0;0;0;0
ss220;Over charge and unfriendly when you ask about one thing or another 's price being too excessive or not on par with the local market ;1;1;0;0;0
ss221;Service was thorough and effective . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss222;Tasty cousine ,   large selection of food ,   you can fine everything what you want ;0;0;1;0;0
ss223;nice open , clean and crisp atmosphere ;0;0;0;1;0
ss224;There 's a bundle you can buy for 12 wings and pizza for like 22 dollars !;1;0;1;0;0
ss225;They have Jamaican beef patties ;0;0;1;0;0
ss226;First time customers get a 10 % coupon on their website;1;0;0;0;0
ss227;When I called to ask for a refund they said they were unable to and then tried to charge my card without my permission . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss228;The manager was incredibly rude and childish on the phone . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss229;their local pickup option saves shipping costs ;1;0;0;0;0
ss230;They are very responsive to inquiries online and their turnaround is fast enough that you can often order online and pick up the same day after confirmation ;0;1;0;0;0
ss231;Also look for their sales , especially the dings & dents - the games are often barely hurt , but can be good discounts on already great prices ;1;0;0;0;0
ss232;Yes ! Sunshine roll and a seaweed salad for ten bucks ;1;0;1;0;0
ss233;The interior is sparkling clean , the machines are efficient and in good repair , and the area it 's in is aesthetically pleasing as well ;0;0;0;1;0
ss234;The bench outside is under a couple of trees and is a nice place to sit and people watch as well . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss235;The service provider was very polite , professional , and considerate of being clean ( he was courteous enough to remove his shoes before entering my home without me having to ask ) ;0;1;0;0;0
ss236;Their service price is on the higher - end , but their work is seamless , clean , professional , and complete ;1;1;0;0;0
ss237;I love street food but this is mediocre Street food gone overpriced ! ;1;0;1;0;0
ss238;This is a sit down street food establishment that is priced as high as a upscale restaurant but the deliciousness of the food is not as high as street food . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss239;We tried the wings , the prawn clay pot and the crepe . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss240;The 45 minutes wait was 45 minutes too long .;0;1;0;0;0
ss241;The falafel was texture wise really good but the taste factor was not there just like the rest of my food unfortunately . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss242;Great place , however , lately there have been a ton of flies inside the restaurant ;0;0;0;1;0
ss243;The only down side is the prices are n't necessarily cheap depending on what your budget is but I believe you get what you pay for here ;1;0;0;0;0
ss244;I got a margherita panini , which is one of their many veggie options , and my husband had a bison burger . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss245;They were so helpful and attentive . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss246;Even on a Friday they had 2 $ off drafts .;1;0;0;0;0
ss247;We got The Man size beer which was freakin huge for $ 2.99;1;0;1;0;0
ss248;The setting is awesome with a lodgelike setting . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss249;Lots of outdoor seating as well . ;0;0;0;1;0

ss254;Very pricey for a bad meal ;1;0;0;0;0

ss256;Not a great place to go on a Friday or Saturday night if you want to have conversation because the crowd gets loud . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss257;No real depth to their selection but the price is right and they will have at least something for everyone ... ;1;0;0;0;0
ss258;Large selection of your standard beers , liquors and wines ... ;0;0;1;0;0
ss259;$ 30 for a meal I would n't eat if given a second chance for a do over;1;0;0;0;0
ss260;Very disappointed in the meals and price ;1;0;0;0;0
ss261;the staff , vanguards of vigilant satisfaction and scholars of fun and entertainment . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss262;Not only do these wonderful people create food to come back for again and again , but the price is right ! ;1;1;0;0;0
ss263;He cares about his clients and is always available when we need him . ;0;1;0;0;0

ss265;Service generally was slow and unknowledgeable . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss266;The chicken biscuit with the pepper jam is a must have . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss267;The food came out quickly and was hot and fresh ;0;1;0;0;0

ss274;The chairs are super comfortable and the prices are reasonable . ;1;0;0;1;0
ss275;I came on my lunch break and I was impressed with fast friendly service ;0;1;0;0;0
ss276;Like , say , 2 lobsters for $ 26 cooked all plump and tender and smothered in the most divine garlic , ginger and green onion sauce that will have you licking your fingers , licking your chin and licking your partner 's face because it 's so damn delicious .;1;0;1;0;0
ss277;Everything is a little pricey but the ingredients are great quality , so it 's worth it ;1;0;0;0;0

ss282;Nicole and Alison at the front were extremely welcoming when I arrived and made me feel very comfortable . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss283;I then had my consultation with Dr. Kruy directly .... and it was FREE ! ;1;1;0;0;0
ss284;Other places I had called wanted close to $ 500 before I even met the Dr;1;0;0;0;0
ss285;The staff really was engaging , and helped me , a novice , choose paints , brushes , talked with me about techniques , and told me where to go for more information ;0;1;0;0;0
ss286;I can not give more than 4 stars though , because the prices were just too high for what you get .;1;0;0;0;0
ss287;They have a pretty decent selection of macarons as well , not as wide as Le Macaron , but definitely cheaper and just as good . ;1;0;1;0;0
ss288;There was a French lady in that day and she really knew her stuff . She was so friendly and full of smiles . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss289;Prices are high the bud is not the best . ;1;0;1;0;0
ss290;My only prior complaint was the cramped space , but since the recent expansion , this is no longer an issue . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss291;I do not care about paying money for my sushi but this was not worth the price ;1;0;0;0;0

ss304;Customer service was lacking in terms of front desk staff but the student that I got was terrific and did a good job with my haircut.;0;1;0;0;0
ss305;"Busy place. Less options for ""buffet"". Quite expensive. You pay for the buffet and you pay extra for grilling.";1;0;0;0;0
ss306;Over priced. Two patch sewn on and a small whole hemmed. 20$ last and only time. Miss me with tht. She must be trying to make her Buckhead rent.;1;0;0;0;0
ss307;Very expensive for a plastic cup togo dessert but ... Disney. The salted caramel sundae was really good. Share it!;1;1;0;0;0
ss308;2 pitchers of (Sam Adams) beer $50. I like the dive vibe but that is unheard of even for the Financial District.;1;0;0;1;0
ss309;I love this restaurant all of my experiences there have been great. I encourage everyone to try it someday but beware it's pricy.;1;0;0;0;0
ss310;For $7 to get in the door including adults than more money to ride some of the few things they have skip it and go to Leeds farm.;1;0;0;0;0
ss311;I was able to get a next day appointment.  Had my rear window replaced and it came out great.  Price was competitive.;1;0;0;0;0

ss319;Ssshhh ... don't tell any more people about this place!;0;0;0;0;1
ss320;From the outside it looks like a cinderblock dive. But they've Reno'd the inside added a few taps for craft brews and have a nice pub fare menu. Definitely worth finding. Perfect lunch stop.;0;0;0;1;0
ss321;Fabulous Food! Loved the Classic Tomato Soup and Grilled Cheese Sandwich! Where Good Food Meets Fun!!!! 2 thumbs up!;0;0;1;0;0

ss323;The food was great. The waiter was friendly and attentive. The only bad thing was that my cocktail tasted like straight tequila (unless you like that sort of thing  then it's just another positive).;0;1;1;0;0
ss324;"Yuk. Untuckit shirts fit my 5' 8: husband to a glove- perfect. But the fabric is awfully cheap for a $90+ shirt "" and has a ""perma-smell"" that leads us to avoid this product.‚Äù";1;0;1;0;0

ss326;No vegan donuts and $1 charge to use oat milk as creamer in my coffee? No thanks! I get the draw but as a vegan this place is unfriendly.;1;1;1;0;0
