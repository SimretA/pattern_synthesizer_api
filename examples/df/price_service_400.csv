ss0;Had a really awkward time ordering a beer because nothing on the menu was stocked . ;0;1;1;0;0
ss1;I really enjoyed ( non - sarcastically ) having an overpriced drink here because it reminded me of New York . ;1;0;0;1;0
ss2;We got here just before the peak lunch crowd on a Saturday morning , and still had to wait 30 minutes , which gave us enough time to find parking down the street .;0;1;0;1;0
ss3;Hence the food is way too pricey for what 's offered ;1;0;0;0;0
ss4;I can not believe someone was not satisfied with the quality of the chicken at this location ! ;0;0;1;0;0
ss5;I love their location in LA and was hoping to get the great service I usually get when I shop over there . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss6;Delicious food , friendly people , quick . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss7;Horrible service attitude . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss8;Great service at lunch . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss9;Environment is very open , clean and comfortable . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss10;Our server actually seemed annoyed that he had to talk with us ... Just another table and more faces ... More orders ... Move it along . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss11;She even stayed with me after closing to make sure I got everything I needed ;0;1;0;0;0
ss12;WAY OVER PRICED ! $ 39 for the dish pictured .;1;0;0;0;0
ss13;The decor looks a little old fashioned , but that actually adds to the feel and I like it . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss14;They do not accept reservations , but it is worth the wait . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss15;The product itself is a repellent combination of over intense flavours ;0;0;1;0;0
ss16;For how much it cost , it could have been better . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss17;Parking can be a issue and they no longer have the dog pen . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss18;All you can say is yuuummmmmmmmyy , the line was n't bad given we were there around 3 pm;0;1;0;0;0
ss19;The shoe was on special price so we got a good deal and bought the shoe as well ! ;1;0;1;0;0
ss20;Service is n't great either . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss21;This mall actually feels like one in Las Vegas . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss22;I love that for things you order regularly you can establish a standing order and get a 5 % discount ( milk , eggs , etc . ) .;1;0;0;0;0
ss23;The servers were a bit confused ;0;1;0;0;0
ss24;It was a little last minute and they were extremely accommodating . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss25;Super quick food lines and attentive employees . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss26;This place is a treasure , and the atmosphere is amazing as well . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss27;For the price I paid , I get more with a vist to another fast food competitor . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss28;Everything fresh and all full of flavor . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss29;The food quality is average and their service is slower than slow ;0;1;0;0;0
ss30;For under $ 7 you get a custom made sub sandwich .;1;0;1;0;0
ss31;It was definitely not worth the money ;1;0;0;0;0
ss32;Very dark and stylish and clearly they were aiming for something of a cross between a club feel date night and just a nice evening out that you would like to bring someone special . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss33;The only problem we really had was the ladies at the front office were sorta rude and looked annoyed at us . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss34;some of the items they sale here are a bit over priced but if you do n't mind paying a bit extra this is the place to go . ;1;0;0;1;0
ss35;slow but courteous . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss36;The ambience , service , and food was pretty cool here . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss37;Unbelievable , it was me & my mother so it was a total of 100 $ i could have gone to red lobster and ate better quality of food .;1;0;0;0;0
ss38;The meal was delicious   and reasonably priced . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss39;The guy told me if I buy a $ 5 sub then I get less vegetables than an $ 8 sub .;1;0;0;0;0
ss40;The only negatives are that the inside is really small , so seating is incredibly cramped and could not accommodate groups ;0;0;0;1;0
ss41;And it 's terribly over priced for the quality . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss42;The dipping ramen was slightly too salty . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss43;Well , massively disappointed with this place . Fries were cold , I mean 5 HOUR cold ! ! The burger ? Smashed together like they were trying to save space in bvb yge bag .;0;0;1;0;0
ss44;50 $ for buffet and mind you i only ate crab legs;1;0;0;0;0
ss45;Too many other places to shop with better prices . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss46;I bought a Living Social deal $ 30 for $ 60 awhile back .;1;0;1;0;0
ss47;I sat outdoors and enjoyed the nice string lighting and music that was playing ;0;0;0;1;0
ss48;They have some great offers going on now with even 70 % off on some items .;1;0;0;0;0
ss49;Jimmy really cares about his customers and his craft . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss50;My other dining companions seemed pleased with their food ( one ordered a veal marsala that I did not try and the other - my favorite - ordered off the menu , actually , a request they were kind enough to accommodate - it was gnocchi caprese with pesto sauce instead of tomato sauce , and it was gooeyyummydelicious ) ! ;0;1;1;0;0
ss51;The food is awesome , fresh , delicious and the best part is , it 's still healthy . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss52;It took the one and only waitress at least 1 hour to serve our food .;0;1;0;0;0
ss53;the interior is clean and has an almost perfect health rating ;0;0;0;1;0
ss54;A little expensive but I 'll definitely be back time and time again ;1;0;0;0;0
ss55;And they let me apply the discount to both of our tickets . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss56;The food was delicious , and the cake was to die for . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss57;Great chicken , but go during a weekday lunch time to avoid the crowds ;0;0;1;0;0
ss58;No appointment on a Saturday afternoon and they managed to get me in and out in an hour . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss59;The seafood was not fresh . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss60;The food is pretty good ;0;0;1;0;0
ss61;I did end up finding the perfect doll . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss62;Overpriced wanna be burger and brew place . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss63;The staff is always friendly and they make you feel comfortable even when you 're getting uncomfortable work done . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss64;Everything we tried so far was delicious ! ;0;0;1;0;0
ss65;Their service is typically slow and unfriendly ;0;1;0;0;0
ss66;Environment was lively and diverse . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss67;Not worth the 40.00 for a basic cut .;1;0;0;0;0
ss68;I am not from the area , and parking is tough ;0;0;0;1;0
ss69;The portion sizes here are gigantic .... we ordered based on our hunger level and should have ordered one plate to share . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss70;Unfortunately several times its been undercooked where literally another 90sec would ' ve made it awesome;0;0;1;0;0
ss71;They need to chill on their prices . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss72;Customer service told me nothing was rescheduled ;0;1;0;0;0
ss73;Our host Reinhold is so nice and gracious . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss74;The manager and staff were friendly , which is always a nice bonus . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss75;Prices are not bad and they have a good amount of seats ( and take reservations ) . ;1;1;0;1;0
ss76;I felt like I was at a fine dining establishment . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss77;Very reasonably priced and came right on budget . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss78;"The food is quite tasty , but the operation around is , let 's say "" challenged "" . ";0;1;1;0;0
ss79;She then decided that the only thing to do was be rude to me . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss80;$ 45 for three of us with large appetites .;1;0;0;0;0
ss81;Do not eat here , it is unsanitary . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss82;It 's such a modern restaurant but their dishes are authentic and super delicious ;0;0;1;0;0
ss83;ALL of the Mexican food was HALF PRICE . ;1;0;1;0;0
ss84;Always a good time ! The food was on point as always .. They can cook a Steak like no other ! Sometimes better than the keg . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss85;However , once our dinner came I thought the food was average at best . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss86;There 's nothing striking about the environment or decor here , but do not leave without trying the dried , sautéed green beans ;0;0;1;1;0
ss87;The staff is very kind and knowledgeable , and they remember my pup 's name when I bring him in . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss88;I was looking for golf shoes , and found some that felt good and fit well but had no price . ;1;0;1;0;0
ss89;The staff and service was really good . I highly recommend this place . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss90;Also , the smell of the restaurant was very bothersome . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss91;Staff is nice and would help to fulfill your requests . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss92;The restaurant is inside an old style passenger train , which gives it more character . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss93;I went by around 1:30p on a Friday and there were still plenty of tables available even though they were busy and had nice outdoor seating as well .;0;0;0;1;0
ss94;When we were about to pay , the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the 1/2 off Scoutmob deal , so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except $ 8 difference ... REALLY ? ! ?;1;1;0;0;0
ss95;The server ( Scottie ) I think was trying to hard to be funny and came across as rude and careless in my opinion . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss96;This is the best sushi in town ;0;0;1;0;0
ss97;Friendly staff . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss98;The waiting staff were very nice . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss99;All the instructors are friendly and helpful . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss100;Some of the items they sale here are a bit over priced ;1;0;0;0;0
ss101;Me : Then why did you tell me they were on discount ? ;1;0;0;0;0
ss102;Our waitress and the Manager are what make good establishments exceptional . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss103;Perfect little spot with healthy options and everything was so delicious . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss104;Only downside : three entrees served simultaneously but fourth ( beet/ goat cheese ravioli ) was 2 - 3 minutes later which allowed my accompaniments ( delicious creamy polenta ) to cool off to much .;0;1;1;0;0
ss105;We arrived at 6 pm and the employees told us the order was n't ready .;0;1;0;0;0
ss106;I tried to contact them through the app and website and still have n't heard back . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss107;The wait staff is attentive and knowledge ;0;1;0;0;0
ss108;The girl at check in that took my info just started typing away and did not explain anything to me . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss109;Friendly w / great customer service , reasonable prices , and a chill atmosphere ;1;1;0;1;0
ss110;The service is excellent and the family feel of this place is so great . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss111;Prices were reasonable and mission accomplished ! ;1;0;0;0;0
ss112;They should be shut down for terrible service . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss113;The main squeeze was definitely the value and quality of our meal . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss114;For the amenities and $ paid , it 's small . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss115;He ordered the tires , gave me a great price and it was done that same day . ;1;1;0;0;0
ss116;The ladies that work here are all so friendly ! ;0;1;0;0;0
ss117;Lots of free parking in the rear of the restaurant . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss118;The BBQ is wonderful and they have maybe the best collard greens I have had in the US . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss119;It was clear that she was more concerned with being right than being helpful . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss120;This camp has a loving , nurturing atmosphere that allows kids of all backgrounds and levels of arts experience to excel . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss121;Employees have horrible attitudes ! ;0;1;0;0;0
ss122;the Pork Belly rice is also really good ;0;0;1;0;0
ss123;My only issue was the cleanliness of the restaurant . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss124;they are kind , polite , and take the time to explain everything ;0;1;0;0;0
ss125;but they are more expensive than what I ' ve paid in the past and what another shop charges ;1;0;0;0;0
ss126;Rodney and his crew gave us a great price and did the work so quick , literally , it was done before we knew it ;1;1;0;0;0
ss127;I assumed because they are located next to Intel ,   they figured they could charge a ridiculous price for a style . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss128;For the money we paid ( over 80 $ for 1 appetizer , 2 dinners , 2 drinks ) we could not eat much;1;0;0;0;0
ss129;This is the worst place for a hairstyle . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss130;Attentive and friendly service . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss131;Give me a good waiter and decent food and it 's hard to not impress . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss132;Poor quality sirloin covered in a thick brown sauce . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss133;Only complaint is they 're expensive ( $ 6.25 for 8) and the sizing is not consistent .;1;1;0;0;0
ss134;Gorgeous , gorgeous , gorgeous interior design , with small outdoor area . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss135;This particular location has a good check in deal . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss136;Pepe is usually there also greeting his customers with a smile and making sure everyone is taken care of . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss137;Even though the stuff is probably overpriced , you ca n't help but just want to buy up the whole store and bring it home with you . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss138;Reception hung up on me multiple times and would not listen . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss139;My phone screen was replaced in 30 minutes and looks great .;0;1;0;0;0
ss140;Always helpful , always wonderful , always available . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss141;My manicure was sloppy and uneven . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss142;all the staff there is amazing . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss143;Pricing reflects the demand -- it 's not CHEAP indian food ( Though not very expensive either ) . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss144;the waiter was friendly and helpful ;0;1;0;0;0
ss145;The store was clean and well organized ;0;0;0;1;0
ss146;Booking was easy , the staff was friendly , and they communicated very well . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss147;I purchased a Gibeon Meteorite and black zirconium wedding band from Rings Unique for approximately $ 1200 .;1;0;1;0;0
ss148;The food was n't half bad either , but I had the bar food staples . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss149;Rate increases totaling 36 % over 3 months resulted in my canceling my account here .;1;0;0;0;0
ss150;She also refused to provide the name of her boss in order for me to complain about the experience . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss151;Paid over $ 80 for a king crab leg with an upgraded side and two beers .;1;0;0;0;0
ss152;Dear Hyatt Place , if you are going to charge $ 75 for a pet fee , then tell me that my pet is n't allowed through the front door and lobby;1;0;0;0;0
ss153;Prices here are very reasonable ! ;1;0;0;0;0
ss154;Slowest coffee shop I ' ve been to in boston . Took 15 minutes for me to get a breakfast sandwich .;0;1;0;0;0
ss155;I like their outdoor seating in the front with sun . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss156;There is usually no wait for lunch but it can take really long to get a table at night ( they don´t take reservations ) . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss157;The owners are the nicest people and the service is excellent . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss158;They were clearly not equipped for a group our size ;0;0;0;1;0
ss159;Only issue I have with this place is that they ' ve raised their prices twice in the last year and now it 's $ 2.10 for almost every plate which I think is very high for what you get;1;0;0;0;0
ss160;Prices vary so you have to shop around , but every once in a while you can find a really awesome deal . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss161;They have coupons discount for first second and third time customers through their website ;1;0;0;0;0
ss162;My parents told me a horror story about their friends ' wedding photographer , who insisted on always getting the shot he wanted . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss163;This place is only worth your time if you are looking for discount designer jeans ;1;0;0;0;0
ss164;The waiter was also really nice and the atmosphere is beautiful . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss165;Jamaal is a great instructor and provides personalised and hands - on corrections to ensure you get the best workout . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss166;The server was cold and seemingly uninterested in making our experience pleasant ;0;1;0;0;0
ss167;Extremely quick response to an appointment request and was able to groom our dog the very next day . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss168;The decor was cute and the service was quick . ;0;1;0;1;0
ss169;The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded , but he will not listen to them , and that she was ' proceeding to cancel this call ' .. ;0;1;0;0;0
ss170;While he checked on the price ( which seemed to take much more effort than it should have ) , I found the shoes on - line for almost half the price . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss171;Service exceptional . Continuously filling waters , etc . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss172;You get a much much larger portion for the same price at SFU ( the bowl is over - flowing ) . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss173;I still believe he did n't want to help to sit us together and used poor judgement setting up the tables ;0;1;0;0;0
ss174;The staff here were very pleasant even through the cancellation process , and seemed to realize that someone 's ending use of a unit did n't have to mean permanent loss of a customer . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss175;He was also slow on refilling our waters throughout the meal . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss176;Adult tickets are $ 13.50 but they have military discount .;1;0;0;0;0
ss177;disappointed in the fact they do n't tell you the price ;1;0;0;0;0
ss178;Great customer service , great food that is fresh and cooked to order . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss179;Sushi menu was pretty standard and the flavor was nothing special . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss180;The attention to customers I observed to be very good and free computer use is available in the lobby . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss181;Management is drippy ;0;1;0;0;0
ss182;The place was beautiful , immaculately clean , comfortable bedding ( lovely sheets ) and breakfast was delicious . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss183;We never get utensils , and it takes a great deal of effort to flag anyone down for refills or to order food ;0;1;0;0;0
ss184;It is a surreal experience and profound in that you live for a few hours as a blind person would , being served by a blind person . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss185;Appointment was quick and the staff was incredibly friendly . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss186;There was a nice beer and cocktail list to choose from as well . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss187;Today we waited over ten minutes behind one car in the drive thru for their single order ;0;1;0;0;0
ss188;Everyone is kind and professional , with no pretense . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss189;The flavors were not the best and the froyo itself was watery . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss190;They do not fill up your ice cream because they say they leave room so you can take your cap off , what about the big hole in the center of the lid ? ;0;0;1;0;0
ss191;They have an awesome return policy which makes me confident about the stuff I buy there . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss192;The rooms are nice , spacious and cozy . The huge 42 inch flat screen TV mounted to the wall made it covienent to watch TV from the cozy sectional or while in bed;0;0;0;1;0
ss193;there is no sense of urgency of your time at all ;0;1;0;0;0
ss194;I ordered mango & taro moochi in coconut milk for $ 6;1;0;1;0;0
ss195;Nail Time lowered their prices ;1;0;0;0;0
ss196;Service was awful , bathrooms were filthy and Wellesley 's stupid blue law about requiring every patron to order food while drinking is absurb . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss197;Fabulous service and awesome food ;0;1;0;0;0
ss198;Very very friendly and they made an effort with us . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss199;The manager that did my nails has the worst personality . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss200;Good food with great variety . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss201;This man is unstable and incompetent as a manager ;0;1;0;0;0
ss202;the lines may be long at times ;0;1;0;0;0
ss203;Our order was wrong as well as missing items . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss204;The portions are perfectly sized to fill you up without any leftovers . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss205;"Bubble teas are not so good ; they are cheap , so they are probably just right for the price . ";1;0;1;0;0
ss206;Large selection of dishes for under $ 9 and there is tons of food .;1;0;0;0;0
ss207;Better prices than most places for lobster rolls and seafood platters . ;1;0;1;0;0
ss208;Have not purchased fresh seafood here before but it 's available if you want it . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss209;Ladies at the counter are super helpful and friendly . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss210;We really enjoyed the BBQ ribs , brisket , and pulled pork . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss211;The building is pretty shanty like but the food is good . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss212;The black eyes peas and cornbread are delicious ! ;0;0;1;0;0
ss213;The restaurant was clean . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss214;Lots of picnic tables outside with lots of bees and flies buzzing around . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss215;Very covid friendly . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss216;It is a little pricy though , I drop about $ 200 per visit .;1;0;0;0;0
ss217;Not a cheap date , my pup ;1;0;0;0;0
ss218;there 's construction right in front of the building so parking and getting around are a bit difficult ;0;0;0;1;0
ss219;Not always worth the price for me , 4/5;1;0;0;0;0
ss220;Over charge and unfriendly when you ask about one thing or another 's price being too excessive or not on par with the local market ;1;1;0;0;0
ss221;Service was thorough and effective . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss222;Tasty cousine ,   large selection of food ,   you can fine everything what you want ;0;0;1;0;0
ss223;nice open , clean and crisp atmosphere ;0;0;0;1;0
ss224;There 's a bundle you can buy for 12 wings and pizza for like 22 dollars !;1;0;1;0;0
ss225;They have Jamaican beef patties ;0;0;1;0;0
ss226;First time customers get a 10 % coupon on their website;1;0;0;0;0
ss227;When I called to ask for a refund they said they were unable to and then tried to charge my card without my permission . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss228;The manager was incredibly rude and childish on the phone . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss229;their local pickup option saves shipping costs ;1;0;0;0;0
ss230;They are very responsive to inquiries online and their turnaround is fast enough that you can often order online and pick up the same day after confirmation ;0;1;0;0;0
ss231;Also look for their sales , especially the dings & dents - the games are often barely hurt , but can be good discounts on already great prices ;1;0;0;0;0
ss232;Yes ! Sunshine roll and a seaweed salad for ten bucks ;1;0;1;0;0
ss233;The interior is sparkling clean , the machines are efficient and in good repair , and the area it 's in is aesthetically pleasing as well ;0;0;0;1;0
ss234;The bench outside is under a couple of trees and is a nice place to sit and people watch as well . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss235;The service provider was very polite , professional , and considerate of being clean ( he was courteous enough to remove his shoes before entering my home without me having to ask ) ;0;1;0;0;0
ss236;Their service price is on the higher - end , but their work is seamless , clean , professional , and complete ;1;1;0;0;0
ss237;I love street food but this is mediocre Street food gone overpriced ! ;1;0;1;0;0
ss238;This is a sit down street food establishment that is priced as high as a upscale restaurant but the deliciousness of the food is not as high as street food . ;1;0;0;0;0
ss239;We tried the wings , the prawn clay pot and the crepe . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss240;The 45 minutes wait was 45 minutes too long .;0;1;0;0;0
ss241;The falafel was texture wise really good but the taste factor was not there just like the rest of my food unfortunately . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss242;Great place , however , lately there have been a ton of flies inside the restaurant ;0;0;0;1;0
ss243;The only down side is the prices are n't necessarily cheap depending on what your budget is but I believe you get what you pay for here ;1;0;0;0;0
ss244;I got a margherita panini , which is one of their many veggie options , and my husband had a bison burger . ;0;0;1;0;0
ss245;They were so helpful and attentive . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss246;Even on a Friday they had 2 $ off drafts .;1;0;0;0;0
ss247;We got The Man size beer which was freakin huge for $ 2.99;1;0;1;0;0
ss248;The setting is awesome with a lodgelike setting . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss249;Lots of outdoor seating as well . ;0;0;0;1;0

ss256;Not a great place to go on a Friday or Saturday night if you want to have conversation because the crowd gets loud . ;0;0;0;1;0
ss257;No real depth to their selection but the price is right and they will have at least something for everyone ... ;1;0;0;0;0
ss258;Large selection of your standard beers , liquors and wines ... ;0;0;1;0;0
ss259;$ 30 for a meal I would n't eat if given a second chance for a do over;1;0;0;0;0
ss260;Very disappointed in the meals and price ;1;0;0;0;0
ss261;the staff , vanguards of vigilant satisfaction and scholars of fun and entertainment . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss262;Not only do these wonderful people create food to come back for again and again , but the price is right ! ;1;1;0;0;0

ss274;The chairs are super comfortable and the prices are reasonable . ;1;0;0;1;0
ss275;I came on my lunch break and I was impressed with fast friendly service ;0;1;0;0;0
ss276;Like , say , 2 lobsters for $ 26 cooked all plump and tender and smothered in the most divine garlic , ginger and green onion sauce that will have you licking your fingers , licking your chin and licking your partner 's face because it 's so damn delicious .;1;0;1;0;0

ss285;The staff really was engaging , and helped me , a novice , choose paints , brushes , talked with me about techniques , and told me where to go for more information ;0;1;0;0;0
ss286;I can not give more than 4 stars though , because the prices were just too high for what you get .;1;0;0;0;0
ss287;They have a pretty decent selection of macarons as well , not as wide as Le Macaron , but definitely cheaper and just as good . ;1;0;1;0;0
ss288;There was a French lady in that day and she really knew her stuff . She was so friendly and full of smiles . ;0;1;0;0;0
ss289;Prices are high the bud is not the best . ;1;0;1;0;0

ss308;2 pitchers of (Sam Adams) beer $50. I like the dive vibe but that is unheard of even for the Financial District.;1;0;0;1;0
ss309;I love this restaurant all of my experiences there have been great. I encourage everyone to try it someday but beware it's pricy.;1;0;0;0;0
ss310;For $7 to get in the door including adults than more money to ride some of the few things they have skip it and go to Leeds farm.;1;0;0;0;0

ss319;Ssshhh ... don't tell any more people about this place!;0;0;0;0;1
ss320;From the outside it looks like a cinderblock dive. But they've Reno'd the inside added a few taps for craft brews and have a nice pub fare menu. Definitely worth finding. Perfect lunch stop.;0;0;0;1;0
